    <!-- TODO: extension ideas
      - [from my baby] if snake eats a 'phase' power up (purple), allow snake to go through self once (per power up)
      - if snake eats a 'teleport' power up (blue), allow snake to go through a wall to the opposite side of board once (per power up)
      - 'expand'/'enhance' power up that makes the board larger (& so snake has more room to maneuver)
      - some sort of efficiency penalty for 'snaking around' a lot (more blocks travelled, more time spent) ?
      - add sensitity, game speed sliders to UI
      - requestAnimationFrame instead of setTimeout https://stackoverflow.com/a/38709924
          - more: https://dev.to/moyedx3/10-settimeout-setinterval-and-requestanimationframe-1io4
      - high score tracking
      - debug mode: extra logging, output info to screen (like canvas dimensions, etc.)
      - "snek refers to images of snakes with interior monologue captioning applied" (knowyourmeme)
          - add thought bubbles at random as the snek eats its food?
      - iOS safari issues:
          - swipe up to full screen not working
